MD5 (message-digest algorithm) is a cryptographic protocol used for authenticaing messsages as well as content
verification and digital signatires.  MD5 is based on a hash function that verifies that a file you sent mathes the file received by the perseon you sent it to.<p>

SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm

    import os

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

Fernet encryption algorithm

1.) Encrypt and decrypt string, encrypt file (Python)
2.) Output encrypted md5 hash# cryptography_prog_2022<p>
3.) Python can encrypt passwords, files, <p>
4.) cryptography.fernet import Fernet (then decrypt)<p>
5.) Show example usage of command line arguments (getopt)<p>
